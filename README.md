# üìã **AssetSync - Concept Specification Document**
## Resale Value Tracking and Management Application

---

## üéØ **Core Concept Definition**

AssetSync is a mobile application that enables users to **track all their owned assets** and **estimate their future resale value** in real-time. Users register their purchases with the original price and date, then the application continuously calculates the estimated resale value according to different temporal scenarios.

**Concrete example**: I buy a car for ‚Ç¨25,000 today. I plan to sell it in 4 years. The application continuously provides me with three estimates of its value in 4 years: pessimistic (‚Ç¨8,000), realistic (‚Ç¨12,000), optimistic (‚Ç¨16,000), and updates these forecasts based on market evolution.

The concept is built on the fundamental distinction between **personal use** (optimizing private resales) and **professional use** (managing business assets with accounting constraints), while covering **all categories of resellable goods**: vehicles, electronics, appliances, clothing, furniture, sports equipment, luxury items, etc.

## üèóÔ∏è **Dual-Context Architecture**

### **Personal Context: Resale Optimization**

Users register their personal belongings to optimize their resale decisions. The application calculates projected depreciation and identifies optimal selling moments based on user objectives.

**Functional logic**:
- Registration: Item + Purchase price + Purchase date + Planned resale timeframe
- Continuous calculation: Current value + Projected value at target date + Forecast evolution
- Recommendations: Alerts when optimal selling moment approaches or when value drops abnormally

### **Professional Context: Depreciable Asset Management**

Companies register their asset acquisitions to track their book value and market value simultaneously. This enables optimization of renewal decisions by cross-referencing accounting depreciation with actual resale value.

**Functional logic**:
- Registration: Asset + Purchase price + Date + Accounting depreciation period + Assignment
- Dual calculation: Net book value (regulatory depreciation) + Estimated market value
- Decision support: Identify when market value exceeds remaining book value

## üì¶ **Universal Asset Coverage**

### **All Resellable Asset Categories**

The application handles **every category of goods that can be resold**:

**Vehicles**: Cars, motorcycles, boats, RVs, bicycles, electric scooters
**Electronics**: Smartphones, laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, cameras, audio equipment
**Home Appliances**: Refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, vacuum cleaners, small appliances
**Clothing & Fashion**: Designer clothing, shoes, bags, jewelry, watches, accessories
**Furniture**: Sofas, tables, chairs, beds, storage furniture, decorative items
**Sports & Leisure**: Gym equipment, bikes, ski gear, golf clubs, musical instruments
**Tools & Equipment**: Power tools, garden equipment, professional machinery
**Collectibles**: Art, vintage items, books, vinyl records, trading cards

### **Market Value Foundation**

The entire application is built around **real market value** of owned objects. Every feature, calculation, and recommendation is based on actual market data rather than theoretical depreciation curves.

**Core principle**: The true value of an object is what someone is willing to pay for it today on the resale market, not its original price minus arbitrary depreciation.

---

## üî¢ **Multi-Scenario Valuation System**

### **Three-Tier Estimation Approach**

For each object, the application generates three value estimates at the planned selling date:

**Pessimistic Estimate**: Based on worst market conditions historically observed for this category. Corresponds to urgent sale or saturated market conditions.

**Realistic Estimate**: Based on average depreciation trends observed over the last 3 years. Corresponds to normal market sale conditions.

**Optimistic Estimate**: Based on best market conditions, accounting for factors like increasing rarity or collector demand. Corresponds to patient sale with optimal buyer search.

### **Real-Time Market Data Sources**

**Live marketplace data**: Prices observed on Leboncoin, Vinted, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, specialized platforms by category
**Historical depreciation analysis**: Multi-year depreciation curve analysis by object category to identify recurring patterns
**Market impact events**: New model releases, production discontinuations, technological evolution that accelerate or slow depreciation
**Seasonal trends**: Analysis of seasonal demand patterns for different categories (winter sports equipment, summer clothing, etc.)

---

## üì± **Core Functionalities**

### **Simplified Asset Registration**

**Photo-based input**: User photographs the object and purchase receipt. Application automatically recognizes the product and extracts purchase price from the invoice.

**Universal product database**: Automatic recognition of exact references across all categories to ensure estimation accuracy (model, year, specifications).

**Manual input alternative**: For unrecognized objects, guided input with suggestions based on text search and category selection.

### **Real-Time Value Tracking**

**Per-object dashboard**: Value evolution curve since purchase with future projection according to three scenarios.

**Automatic alerts**: Notifications when value reaches user-defined threshold or when optimal selling moment approaches.

**Goal vs reality comparison**: Gap between initially expected value and current estimate for planned selling date.

### **Integrated Selling Support**

**Platform connections**: Direct integration with major resale platforms for automated listing:
- **Leboncoin**: Automatic listing generation with optimized descriptions and pricing
- **Vinted**: Clothing and fashion items with size and condition mapping
- **eBay**: Electronics and collectibles with auction or fixed price options
- **Facebook Marketplace**: Local sales with geographic targeting
- **Specialized platforms**: Category-specific platforms (automotive, luxury goods, etc.)

**Optimal timing calendar**: Suggestions for best selling periods based on category seasonality.

**Impact of new releases**: Automatic alerts when announcement of new models risks accelerating depreciation.

**Multi-platform listing management**: Ability to list the same item on multiple platforms with synchronized inventory.

## üè¢ **Professional Context Specificities**

### **Integrated Accounting Management**

**Dual vision**: Each asset displays both its net book value (according to regulatory depreciation) and estimated market value simultaneously.

**Renewal optimization**: Identification of assets whose market value exceeds residual book value, suggesting early disposal opportunity.

**Accounting export**: Automatic generation of disposal entries with calculated capital gains/losses.

### **Multi-User Management**

**Asset assignment**: Each asset can be assigned to an employee, department, or site with movement history tracking.

**Roles and permissions**: Administrator (all actions), Manager (add/modify), Viewer (read-only), Accountant (export and calculations).

**Validation workflows**: Configurable approval process for acquisitions and disposals based on amounts.

## üéØ **Concrete Use Cases**

### **Personal Use - Lifestyle Optimization**

**Scenario**: John buys a BMW 3 Series for ‚Ç¨35,000. He plans to keep it for 5 years before selling. The application shows he can probably sell it for between ‚Ç¨12,000 (pessimistic) and ‚Ç¨18,000 (optimistic) in 5 years. 6 months before the deadline, the application alerts him that a new generation BMW is being announced and he should sell now at ‚Ç¨20,000 rather than wait.

**Fashion scenario**: Sarah buys a Chanel bag for ‚Ç¨3,000. She wants to sell it in 2 years. The app tracks similar bag sales on Vestiaire Collective and Vinted, showing current resale value at ‚Ç¨2,100 with projection to ‚Ç¨1,800 in 2 years (realistic scenario).

### **Professional Use - Fleet Optimization**

**Scenario**: A startup bought 50 laptops at ‚Ç¨1,500 each 18 months ago. Accounting depreciation is planned over 3 years (current net book value: ‚Ç¨750). The application estimates current market value at ‚Ç¨900 per machine. The company can consider selling them now and buying more recent equipment, realizing an accounting gain while renewing their fleet.
